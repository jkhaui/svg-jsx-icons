# svg-jsx-icons
A small icon pack as configurable SVGs in JSX.

Easily themeable to seamlessly integrate with any project. Just download the zip and import the icons you need.

All icons accept 2 props: `iconSize` and `stroke` (for the colour of the icon). Props default to `16` and `'#37474f'` respectively if nothing is passed to the icon component.
